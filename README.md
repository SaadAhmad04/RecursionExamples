# Recursion Examples in Java

This repository contains examples of basic recursion techniques implemented in Java. The goal of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how recursion works and how it can be applied to solve various problems.

## Contents

### **1. Number-Based Recursion Examples**
- **Find Sum**: Calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- **Factorial**: Computes the factorial of a given number `n`.
- **Fibonacci Series**: Generates the Fibonacci series up to the `n`th term.
- **Power Calculation**:
  - Standard approach (stack height = `y`).
  - Optimized approach (stack height = `log y`).
- **Tower of Hanoi**: Solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for `n` disks.
- **Check Sorted**: Verifies if a given array is sorted.
- **Binary Search**: Checks for an element in a sorted array.

### **2. String-Based Recursion Examples**
- **Reverse a string**: Input a string and it will reverse the entire string.
- **Find first and last occurrence**: Input a string and element and this function will return te first and last index of that element.
- **Move characters**: All the occurrences of character entered will be moved to the last in the string.
- **Subsequence**: It will print all the subsequence of the given string.
- **Unique Subseuqnce**: It will remove the subsequences which are duplicates.
- **Keypad combination**: Generates all possible combinations of characters based on a digit-to-letters mapping (like a mobile keypad). **For example**, for the input "23", it outputs combinations like dg, dh, di, eg, eh, ei, fg, fh, fi
