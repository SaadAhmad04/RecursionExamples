# Recursion Examples in Java

This repository contains examples of basic recursion techniques implemented in Java. The goal of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how recursion works and how it can be applied to solve various problems.

## Contents

### **1. Number-Based Recursion Examples**
- **Find Sum**: Calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- **Factorial**: Computes the factorial of a given number `n`.
- **Fibonacci Series**: Generates the Fibonacci series up to the `n`th term.
- **Power Calculation**:
  - Standard approach (stack height = `y`).
  - Optimized approach (stack height = `log y`).
- **Tower of Hanoi**: Solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for `n` disks.
- **Check Sorted**: Verifies if a given array is sorted.
- **Binary Search**: Checks for an element in a sorted array.

### **2. Upcoming Examples**
- Recursion examples involving strings (to be added soon).
